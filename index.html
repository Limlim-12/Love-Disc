                Hi luv Yeryer! This was our very first picture together. I still remember how nervous I was meeting you,
                scared you might ditch me… but you showed up, and from that moment you made me feel important.
                It’s been a year of ups and downs, but we’re still here, choosing each other. I love you so much — you’ll always be my
                baby, Yeryer. ❤️
